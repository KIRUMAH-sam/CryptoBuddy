## Mini E-Learning Platform

A simple, interactive e-learning prototype built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Developed as part of the VibeCoding Week 1 Assignment, this project demonstrates the integration of front-end development principles and AI-assisted coding.

# Overview

## The platform enables learners to:

🧾 View a list of available courses
📚 Access course details and lessons
✅ Mark courses as completed
🔐 Log in or sign up (front-end only)
💾 Save progress locally using localStorage

The focus is on building a functional and visually clean prototype.
